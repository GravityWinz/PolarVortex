# DESIGN.md

## Frontend (React + Material UI)
- Built using latest Node.js and React version.
- Material UI for consistent design following Material Design guidelines.
- Coding principles:
  - Simplicity and readability first.
  - Well-structured components with clear separation of concerns.
  - Always include inline comments explaining intent and complex logic.

## Backend (FastAPI + Python)
- REST API for commands, uploads, and status.
- WebSocket for real-time updates to frontend.
- Communicates with Arduino over serial.

## Arduino
- Runs minimal C++ sketch (`polargraph.ino`).
- Responds to serial commands (START, STOP, PAUSE, etc.).

## Deployment
- Dockerfiles for frontend and backend.
- docker-compose.yml to orchestrate on Raspberry Pi.
- Firebase hosting for frontend distribution.
